## Unreleased:
  Documenting the possible bundler config settings for this bundler plugin
  Handling any machine-formatted changelogs?
  Don't print changelogs for bundler-plugins. That is one level too much.
  Deathstar operational, to print something out on install, if a gem with a changelog is updated. Will probably break projects and small planets.
  Add a sanity check that a changelog is at least sort of formatted in a parseable way? (as opposed to a jquery/wiki/evil changelog)

## Version 0.0.2
  Still completely broken. But slowly recognizing the problems here.

## Version 0.0.1
  Completely broken. Basically testing rubygems credentials.
